Built jar files are located in the builds directory.

Run the server with

    java -jar builds/server.jar

Run the client with

    java -jar builds/client.jar localhost

If localhost is left off of the client command, it will attempt
to connect to the hosted instance of our server, (it may or may not still be running).
